# What-Breast-cancer-will-recur--Neural-Computation

here we built three Neural-Computation algorithms-perceptron,Adaline and backpropagation.the project done in python. 
we received data set that relating to Breast Cancer recurrence prediction.
The data set has values taken from a mass extracted from a patient suffering 
from breast cancer and then indicates whether or not the cancer recurs and how long it takes.
the link for the data set: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wpbc.data.
in this project the two algorithms perceptron,Adaline were week for this task,but backpropagation was very good for this task-
this will be explain on the reports.in the algorithms we used part of the data to train and the rest for the test.the algorithms need to predict in the test the correct 
output(after training)-whether or not the cancer recurs.
pay attention that the codes are in the word files.the rest of the explanations are on the reports.
